**About me**

I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of St. Gallen. My primary advisor is Reto Föllmi. My research interests cover International Trade, Economic Growth, and Structural Change.

In the academic year 2025/26, I visited 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fjbuera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francisco Buera</a> (Washington University in St. Louis) and 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/valentinyiakos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ákos Valentinyi</a> (University of Manchester) as a Visiting Researcher.

You can find my CV <a href="/files/Academic_CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
