abstract: >
  We introduce a simple two-country, monopolistic competition model of parallel trade policy with potentially imperfect enforcement of parallel trade prohibition. Consumers have 0/1 preferences such that large per capita income differences can induce some Northern firms to refrain from exporting to the South in order to avoid international arbitrage. We show that parallel trade restrictions have a pro-competitive effect on prices and change the terms of trade in favor of the poor country. Hence, the South prefers to ban parallel trade while the North prefers to allow it. The global welfare-maximising policy is to forbid parallel trade. Moreover, trade liberalisation increases the terms of trade of the South if there is a sufficiently strong parallel trade prohibition.
