  The present study develops quality-ladder models of endogenous growth with and without firm heterogeneity. It analyses the eects of trade and trade liberalisation on the level of manufacturing productivity, on firm selection and on the investment into research. In this framework, I demonstrate that trade liberalisation unambiguously tightens firm selection and makes the economy more productive. Additionally, there is a reallocation of resources from non-exporting to exporting industries. Trade liberalisation increases the investment into research for sufficiently small, yet plausible, values of the elasticity of substitution.
