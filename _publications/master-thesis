  The present study develops quality-ladder models of endogenous growth with and without firm heterogeneity. It analyzes the effects of trade and trade liberalization on the level of manufacturing productivity, on firm selection, and on investment in research. In this framework, I demonstrate that trade liberalization unambiguously tightens firm selection and makes the economy more productive. Additionally, there is a reallocation of resources from non-exporting to exporting industries. Trade liberalization increases investment in research for sufficiently small, yet plausible, values of the elasticity of substitution.
