abstract: >
  We develop a two-country model of international trade featuring non-homothetic preferences and income inequality, generating a price schedule where cheap necessities coexist with expensive luxury goods. A central mechanism driving price differences is firmâ€™s ability to shift fixed costs between countries, shaping trade patterns and welfare. In a Northâ€“South setting, poor consumers in the rich country are most negatively affected by this fixed cost shifting, leading to a *Manhattan effect*. Following mean-preserving redistribution, import volumes rise in the unequal country and fall in the more equal one. In an open economy, strictly more consumers lose out from increased inequality compared to the autarky case, due to firms adjusting their pricing-to-market behaviour.
