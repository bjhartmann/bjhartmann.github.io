I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of St. Gallen. My primary advisor is Reto Föllmi. My research interests cover International Trade, Economic Growth, and Structural Change.

In the academic year 2025/26, I visited

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/valentinyiakos/" target="_blank">Ákos Valentinyi</a> (University of Manchester) as a Visiting Researcher.
